# What is JSX ?

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript, similar to a template language, that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files. It is often used with libraries like React, to describe the structure of a user interface in a declarative and concise way.

# Superpower of JSX

There are several benefits to using JSX in your React applications:

**Concise syntax:** JSX allows you to write the structure of your user interface in a concise and declarative way, using familiar HTML-like syntax. This can make your code easier to read and understand, especially for developers who are already familiar with HTML.

**Ease of use:** With JSX, you can define the structure of your user interface directly in your JavaScript code, without having to use separate template files or syntax. This can make it easier to build and maintain complex user interfaces, especially for larger applications.

**Better performance:** Because JSX is compiled into plain JavaScript code, your application will generally have better performance than if you were using a template engine to generate your user interface.

**Improved type checking:** When using JSX with a static type checker like TypeScript, you can get improved type checking and code completion support for your user interface code. This can help you catch errors early and write more reliable code.

**Flexibility:** While JSX is often used with React, it is not limited to React and can be used with other libraries or frameworks as well. This can give you more flexibility in your choice of tools and technologies.

# Role of type attribute in script tag? what options can i use there

The type attribute in a script element specifies the type of script being used. It is optional, but if included, it must be set to a valid MIME type.

There are several possible values for the type attribute, including:

text/javascript: This is the default value, and indicates that the script is written in JavaScript.
text/ecmascript: This is similar to text/javascript, but indicates that the script is written in ECMAScript, a standardized version of JavaScript.
application/javascript: This is similar to text/javascript, but indicates that the script is a JavaScript application.
application/ecmascript: This is similar to application/javascript, but indicates that the script is an ECMAScript application.

Other possible values for the type attribute include text/vbscript, which indicates that the script is written in VBScript, and text/coffeescript, which indicates that the script is written in CoffeeScript.

In general, it is recommended to use text/javascript as the value for the type attribute, unless you are using a different programming language for your script.
