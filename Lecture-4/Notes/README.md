# Is JSX is mandatory for React ?

JSX is not mandatory in React. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files. It is used to describe what the UI should look like and is often used in React components to define the user interface.

You can write React components using plain JavaScript, without using JSX. However, JSX makes it easier to write and understand React components, especially for those who are familiar with HTML. It also allows for easier integration with the React framework, as it is the syntax that is expected when defining a React component.

Overall, while JSX is not mandatory in React, it is a highly recommended tool to use when working with the framework.

# Is ES6 mandatory for React ?

ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) is a version of the JavaScript language that introduced many new features that make writing JavaScript code easier and more efficient. It is not strictly required to use ES6 in order to use React, but many of the features of ES6 are useful when writing React applications, so you may find it helpful to familiarize yourself with them. Some of the features that are particularly useful when working with React include:

1. Arrow functions <br>
2. Classes <br>
3. Template literals <br>
4. Destructuring <br>
5. Modules <br>

Using these features can make your code more concise and easier to read, which can be particularly helpful when working with React's declarative syntax. However, if you are just starting out with React and are not yet comfortable with ES6, you can still use React with plain JavaScript.

# How can i write comment in JSX ?

It's important to note that the comment syntax used in JSX is different from the comment syntax used in JavaScript. In JavaScript, you would use // to write a single-line comment or /(\*) and (\*)/ to write a multi-line comment.

In JSX <br>
{(\*)astric This comment will not be rendered to the page astric(\*)}

# What is <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> and <></> ?

<React.Fragment></React.Fragment> and <></> are both ways to create a placeholder element in React that does not get rendered to the DOM. They are often used when a component needs to return multiple elements but React does not allow a component to return multiple elements directly.

In each component of react threre is must be one parent Node which can be <div> but if you create div than it create extra div and add extra node to react dom so we use React Fragment to avoid this we use React Fragment so React will not render this. and doesn't create any extra div.

# What is virtual DOM ?

Virtual DOM (Virtual Document Object Model) is a programming concept in which a virtual representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the actual DOM. It serves as an intermediary between the data model and the actual DOM, minimizing the number of DOM manipulation operations required to update the UI.

The Virtual DOM acts as a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM, and it allows developers to make changes to the UI without directly touching the DOM. When a change is made to the data model, the Virtual DOM creates a new virtual tree representing the updated UI. It then compares this new tree to the previous virtual tree, calculates the minimum number of changes required to update the actual DOM, and then makes those changes. This process is known as "reconciliation".

Using the Virtual DOM can greatly improve the performance of applications that make frequent updates to the UI, because it reduces the number of expensive DOM manipulation operations that are required.

# What is reconciliation in React ?

In React, reconciliation is the process of taking the virtual DOM representation of a UI component and updating the actual DOM to match it.

When a component's state changes, React creates a new virtual DOM representation of the component. It then compares this new virtual DOM representation to the previous one, and determines the minimum number of DOM manipulations required to update the actual DOM to match the new virtual DOM. This process is known as "reconciliation".

React uses a fast and efficient algorithm to perform reconciliation, which helps to ensure that the process of updating the UI is as fast as possible. This allows React applications to deliver a smooth and responsive user experience, even when the UI is being updated frequently.

# What is React Fiber ?

React Fiber is a rewrite of the React's core algorithm that was initially released in September 2017. It was designed to improve the performance of React applications by better managing the rendering work that is needed to update the UI.

One of the main goals of React Fiber was to make it easier for the React team to implement new features that require complex rendering behavior, such as the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in. It also aims to improve the perceived performance of React applications by spreading work over multiple frames, so that the UI is always responsive to user input.

React Fiber works by breaking up rendering work into smaller chunks that can be spread out over multiple frames. This allows the browser to handle other tasks in between rendering work, which can help to make the UI feel more responsive to user input.

Overall, React Fiber aims to make the process of rendering and updating the UI in React applications more efficient and flexible, which can help to improve the performance and user experience of these applications.

# Why we need keys in React? When do we need keys in React ?

In React, when you render a list of elements, it's important to assign a unique "key" prop to each element in the list. This is because React uses keys to uniquely identify elements in the list, and to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be changed when the list is updated.

React can use the keys to determine which items have been added, removed, or moved, and make the minimum number of DOM manipulations necessary to update the list.

In summary, you should use keys whenever you render a list of elements in React, to help React efficiently update the list when the data changes.

# Can we use index as keys in React?

It is generally not recommended to use the index of an element as its key when rendering a list in React.

Keys should be unique and stable, meaning they should not change between renders. If you use the index of an element as its key, the key will change whenever the order of the elements changes, which can lead to unexpected behavior and wasted rendering work.
A better approach is to use a unique and stable identifier for each element, such as a primary key from a database, or a unique ID generated by a library like shortid. This will ensure that the keys remain stable and consistent, even when the order of the elements changes.

In summary, it is generally not recommended to use the index of an element as its key in React, because it can lead to unexpected behavior and wasted rendering work. Instead, you should use a unique and stable identifier for each element.

# What is props in React? Ways to?

In React, "props" (short for "properties") are arguments that you pass to a component when you render it. Props allow you to pass data from a parent component to a child component, and to pass information from one component down the component tree to its descendants.

Props can be of any type, including numbers, strings, arrays, and objects. They are read-only, which means that a component cannot modify its own props, but it can pass them down to its children through the component tree.

There are a few different ways to pass props to a component:

    As an attribute: <Welcome name="Sara" />
    As an object: <Welcome {...user} />
    As a spread operator: <Welcome {...this.props} />

In summary, props are arguments that you pass to a component when you render it, and they allow you to pass data from a parent component to a child component, and to pass information from one component down the component tree to its descendants.

# What is a Config Driven UI ?

A Config Driven UI is a user interface that is designed to be configured or customized using external configuration data, rather than being hard-coded. This allows the behavior and appearance of the UI to be changed without modifying the code that implements it.

There are a few different ways that a Config Driven UI can be implemented. One common approach is to use a declarative language or framework, such as JSON, XML, or a domain-specific language (DSL), to define the configuration data. This configuration data can then be used to generate the UI at runtime, using a template engine or a code generation tool.

Another approach is to use a runtime configuration API, which allows the configuration data to be modified at runtime through programmatic means, such as a REST API or a command-line interface. This can be useful for situations where the configuration data needs to be changed frequently or dynamically, based on user input or other runtime conditions.

Overall, a Config Driven UI can be a useful way to build flexible and customizable user interfaces, as it allows the behavior and appearance of the UI to be easily modified without requiring changes to the underlying code.
